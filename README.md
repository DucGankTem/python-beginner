# python-beginner

This is a smol python package that I made during the summer of 2023. The documentary for each file will be uploaded soon

Note: I didn't upload those resources on GitHub nowadays because due to long-term mental health problems and the impact of different factors in my life. 
I got myself back up and slowly improving my life quality, lastly I will try to upload more packages often this year. Stay tuned!
