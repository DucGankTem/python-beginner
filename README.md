# python-beginner



This is a smol python package that I made during the summer of 2023. The documentary for each file will be uploaded soon. You are welcome to download the file and learn through the process.! 

Note: I didn't upload those resources on GitHub nowadays because due to long-term mental health problems and the impact of different factors in my life. 
I got myself back up and slowly improving my life quality, lastly I will try to upload more packages often this year. Stay tuned!

Update: I need to write down the portfolio and questions of each file, from easy questions to advanced code.
